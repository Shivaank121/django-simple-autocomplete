1. admin/templates/admin/includes/fieldset.html does not mark {{ field.field }}
as safe, eg.  {{ field.field|safe }}. Whenever the admin form encounters this
configuration, eg. when adding a comment, the widget is escaped and the
Javascript cannot fire.

2. Need a way to clear the current selection.
